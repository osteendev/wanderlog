# Visited Places: Code Along

## Goal
The goal of this project is to practice creating objects in JavaScript using constructors and prototypes, and to use test-driven development (TDD) to create the business logic. There should be tests for all functionality in the business logic, and these tests will be included in this README.

## Overview
This project includes a basic application to track places you've visited. Each place is represented by an object with properties such as location, landmarks, time of year, and notes. The user can view the details of each place when they click on the name of a place.

## Project Breakdown
1. **Address Book**: First, we will build an address book application using JavaScript constructors and prototypes.
2. **Places You've Been**: After completing the address book, we'll create a website to track the places you've visited.
3. **Test-Driven Development**: All business logic will be developed using TDD. For each feature, you will write tests, implement the business logic to make the tests pass, and commit your code after each passing test.

## Warm-Up Questions
### What is the difference between creating an object using literal notation and using a constructor?
- **Literal Notation**: An object created with literal notation is defined directly with `{}` syntax. It's quick and simple but not reusable.
